A tool to build and test apps for Giant Swarm App Platform.

This tool is development and CI/CD tool that allows you to:

- build your helm chart
  - do some simple variable replacements before building the chart
  - linting chart's source code
  - generating actual chart archive
  - generating App Platform specific metadata
- test your chart after building

## How to use app-build-suite

### Installation

`abs` is distributed as a docker image, so the easiest way to install and use it is to get our `dabs.sh`
script, which is a wrapper script to make launching the docker image easier.

Alternatively, you can just checkout this repository and build the docker image yourself by running:

```bash
make docker-build
```

### Getting started

Executing `dabs.sh` is the most straight forward way to run `app-build-suite`.
For example, for our sample chart present in this repository in `examples/apps/hello-world-app`, run:

```bash
dabs.sh -c examples/apps/hello-world-app --skip-steps test_all
```

Please note that this command skips all the test steps and runs only the actual chart build steps. If you want
to run tests as well, you need to provide a cluster to run them on. For example, you can use a cluster
of type `external`, which is a cluster you provide externally to the `abs` tool. If you have `kind`, you can do it
like this:

```bash
kind create cluster
```

### Usage

Please run:

```bash
dabs.sh -h
```

to get help about all the available config options.
