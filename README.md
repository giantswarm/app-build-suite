A tool to build and test apps (Helm Charts) for
[Giant Swarm App Platform](https://docs.giantswarm.io/app-platform/).

This tool is a development and CI/CD tool that allows you to:

- build your helm chart
  - do some simple variable replacements before building the chart
  - linting chart's source code
  - generating actual chart archive
  - generating App Platform specific metadata
- test your chart after building
  - run your tests of different kind using [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and
    [`pytest-helm-charts`](https://github.com/giantswarm/pytest-helm-charts)
  - define different test scenarios for your release

## How to use app-build-suite

### Installation

`abs` is distributed as a docker image, so the easiest way to install and use it is to get our `dabs.sh`
script from [releases](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-build-suite/releases). `dabs.sh` is a wrapper script
that launches for you `abs` inside a docker container and provides all the necessary docker options required
to make it work.

Alternatively, you can just checkout this repository and build the docker image yourself by running:

```bash
make docker-build
```

### Tutorial

If you prefer to learn by example, building a simple project step-by-step,
please start with [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md).

### Quick start

Executing `dabs.sh` is the most straight forward way to run `app-build-suite`.
As an example, we have included a chart in this repository in
[`examples/apps/hello-world-app`](examples/apps/hello-world-app/). It's configuration file for
`abs` is in the [.abs/main.yaml](examples/apps/hello-world-app/.abs/main.yaml) file. To build the chart
using `dabs.sh` and the provided config file, run:

```bash
dabs.sh -c examples/apps/hello-world-app --skip-steps test_all
```

Please note that this command skips all the test steps and runs only the actual chart build steps. If you want
to run tests as well, you need to provide a cluster to run them on. For example, you can use a cluster
of type `external`, which is a cluster you provide externally to the `abs` tool. If you have `kind`, you can do it
like this:

```bash
kind create cluster
kind get kubeconfig > ./kube.config
```

Then you can run `abs` to execute tests on top of that `kind` cluster:

```bash
dabs.sh -c examples/apps/hello-world-app \
  --smoke-tests-cluster-type external \
  --functional-tests-cluster-type external \
  --external-cluster-kubeconfig-path kube.config \
  --external-cluster-type kind \
  --external-cluster-version "1.19.0" \
  --destination build
```

### A command wrapper on steroids

`abs` is not much more than a wrapper around a set of well-known open source tools.
It orchestrates these tools into an opinionated build process and adds some additional
features in between them, like generating metadata for the Giant Swarm App Platform.

To better explain it, see what really happens when you call

```bash
dabs.sh -c examples/apps/hello-world-app --destination build --skip-steps test_all
```

The list bellow
is a set of commands executed for you by `abs`:

```bash
# app and chart versions are set using git changes (if configured)
ct lint --validate-maintainers=false --charts=examples/apps/hello-world-app --chart-yaml-schema=/abs/workdir/app_build_suite/build_steps/../../resources/ct_schemas/gs_metadata_chart_schema.yaml
kube-linter lint . --config .kube-linter.yaml
helm package examples/apps/hello-world-app --destination build
# now metadata is generated from the data collected during the build (if configured)
```

If you include testing steps as well, on an external cluster, with the following command

```bash
dabs.sh -c examples/apps/hello-world-app \
  --functional-tests-cluster-type external \
  --smoke-tests-cluster-type external \
  --external-cluster-kubeconfig-path kube.config \
  --external-cluster-type kind \
  --external-cluster-version "1.19.0" \
  --destination build
```

, the list becomes:

```bash
# app and chart versions are set using git changes (if configured)
ct lint --validate-maintainers=false --charts=examples/apps/hello-world-app --chart-yaml-schema=/abs/workdir/app_build_suite/build_steps/../../resources/ct_schemas/gs_metadata_chart_schema.yaml
kube-linter lint . --config .kube-linter.yaml
helm package examples/apps/hello-world-app --destination build
# now metadata is generated from the data collected during the build (if configured)
# here start smoke tests
apptestctl bootstrap --kubeconfig-path=kube.config --wait
pipenv install --deploy
pipenv run pytest -m smoke --cluster-type kind --kube-config /abs/workdir/kube.config --chart-path hello-world-app-0.1.8-1112d08fc7d610a61ace4233a4e8aecda54118db.tgz --chart-version 0.1.8-1112d08fc7d610a61ace4233a4e8aecda54118db --chart-extra-info external_cluster_version=1.19.0 --log-cli-level info --junitxml=test_results_smoke.xml
apptestctl bootstrap --kubeconfig-path=kube.config --wait
# and here start functional tests
pipenv install --deploy
pipenv run pytest -m functional --cluster-type kind --kube-config /abs/workdir/test1.kube.config --chart-path hello-world-app-0.1.8-1112d08fc7d610a61ace4233a4e8aecda54118db.tgz --chart-version 0.1.8-1112d08fc7d610a61ace4233a4e8aecda54118db --chart-extra-info external_cluster_version=1.19.0 --log-cli-level info --junitxml=test_results_functional.xml
```

### Full usage help

To get an overview of available options, please run:

```bash
dabs.sh -h
```

To learn what they mean and how to use them, please follow to
[execution steps and their config options](#execution-steps-details-and-configuration).

## Tuning app-build-suite execution and running parts of the build process

This tool works by executing a series of so called `Build Steps`. In general, one `BuildSteps` is about
a single step in the build, like running a single external tool. Most of the build steps are configurable
(run `./dabs.sh -h` to check available options and go to
[steps details and configuration](#execution-steps-details-and-configuration) for detailed description).

The important property in `app-build-suite` is that you can only execute a subset of all the build steps.
This idea should be useful for integrating `abs` with other workflows, like CI/CD systems or for
running parts of the build process on your local machine during development. You can either run only a
selected set of steps using `--steps` option or you can run all if them excluding some
using `--skip-steps`. Check `dabs.sh -h` output for step names available to `--steps` and `--skip-steps`
flags.

To skip or include multiple step names, separate them with space, like in this example:

```bash
dabs.sh -c examples/apps/hello-world-app --skip-steps test_unit test_performance
```

### Configuring app-build-suite

Every configuration option in `abs` can be configured in 3 ways. Starting from the highest to the lowest
priority, these are:

- command line arguments,
- environment variables,
- config file (`abs` tries first to load the config file from the chart's directory `.abs/main.yaml` file; if
  it doesn't exist, then it tries to load the default config file from the current working directory's
  `.abs.main.yaml`).

When you run `dabs.sh -h` it shows you command line options and the relevant environment variables names. Options
for a config file are the same as for command line, just with truncated leading `--`. You can check
[this example](examples/apps/hello-world-app/.abs/main.yaml).

The configuration is made this way so you can put your defaults into the config file, yet override them with
env variables or command line when needed. This way you can easily override configs for stuff like CI/CD builds.

## Execution steps details and configuration

`abs` is composed of two main pipelines: *build* and *test*. Each of them is composed of steps.
When `abs` runs, it executes all the steps from the *build* pipeline and then from the *test* pipeline.
Config options can be used to disable/enable any specific build steps.

Please check below for available build pipelines and steps and their config options.

### Build pipelines

Currently, only one build pipeline is supported. It is based on `helm 3`. Please check
[this doc](../app-build-suite/docs/helm3-build-pipeline.md) for
detailed description of steps and available config options.

### Test pipelines

After your app artifact is built (your chart when using Helm build engine pipeline), `abs` can run
tests for it for you. There are a few assumptions related to how testing invoked by `abs` works.

First, we assume that each test framework that you can use for developing tests for your app can
label the tests and run only the set of tests labelled. `abs` expects all tests to have at least one
of the following labels: `smoke`, `functional`. It uses the labels to run only certain tests, so `abs`
runs all `smoke` tests first, then all `functional` tests. As concrete example, this mechanism is implemented
as [marks in pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/mark.html) or
[tags in go test](https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#hdr-Build_Constraints).

The idea is that `abs` invokes first the testing framework with `smoke` filter, so that only smoke tests
are invoked. Smoke tests are expected to be very basic and short-lived, so they provide an immediate
feedback if something is wrong and there's no point in running more advanced (and time and resource
consuming tests). Only if `smoke` tests are OK, `functional` tests are invoked to check if the application
works as expected. In the future, we want to introduce `performance` tests for checking for expected
performance results in a well-defined environment and `compatibility` tests for checking strict
compatibility of your app with a specific platform release.

Another important concept is that each type of tests can be run on a different type of Kubernetes cluster.
That way, we want to make a test flow that uses "fail fast" principle: if your tests are going to fail,
make them fail as soon as possible, without creating "heavy" clusters or running "heavy" tests. As an example,
our default config should be something like this:

1. Run `smoke` tests on `kind` cluster. Fail if any test fails.
2. Run `functional` tests on `kind` cluster. We might reuse the `kind` cluster from the step above. But
   we might also need a more powerful setup to be able to test all the `functional` scenarios, so we might
   request a real AWS cluster for that kind of tests. It's for the test developer to choose.

Currently, we only support [`pytest` test pipeline](docs/pytest-test-pipeline.md).
