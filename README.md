A tool to build apps (Helm Charts) for
[Giant Swarm App Platform](https://docs.giantswarm.io/app-platform/).

This tool is a Helm charts development and CI/CD tool that allows you to:

- do some simple variable replacements before building the chart
- lint chart's source code
- run Helm chart code analysis tools
- generate actual chart archive
- generate App Platform specific metadata

In short, it runs an opinionated Helm chart build process as a single configurable build step (one step
build`).

It has a companion tool called [app-test-suite](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-build-suite)
for running dynamic (run-time) tests on charts built.

*Big fat warning* This tool is available as a development version!

## How to use app-build-suite

### Installation

`abs` is distributed as a docker image, so the easiest way to install and use it is to get our `dabs.sh`
script from [releases](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-build-suite/releases). `dabs.sh` is a wrapper script
that launches for you `abs` inside a docker container and provides all the necessary docker options required
to make it work (check te script for details, it's short).

Alternatively, you can just checkout this repository and build the docker image yourself by running:

```bash
make docker-build
```

### Tutorial

If you prefer to learn by example, building a simple project step-by-step,
please start with [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md).

### Quick start

Executing `dabs.sh` is the most straight forward way to run `app-build-suite`.
As an example, we have included a chart in this repository in
[`examples/apps/hello-world-app`](examples/apps/hello-world-app/). It's configuration file for
`abs` is in the [.abs/main.yaml](examples/apps/hello-world-app/.abs/main.yaml) file. To build the chart
using `dabs.sh` and the provided config file, run:

```bash
dabs.sh -c examples/apps/hello-world-app
```

### GitHub Action

We have created a GitHub Action called [push-to-app-catalog](.github/workflows/push-to-app-catalog.yaml)
for publishing apps to an app catalog served with GitHub Pages.
See its [docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/app-platform/create-catalog/#publish-an-app-to-the-app-catalog)
for how to configure it.

### A command wrapper on steroids

`abs` is not much more than a wrapper around a set of well-known open source tools.
It orchestrates these tools into an opinionated build process and adds some additional
features, like generating metadata for the Giant Swarm App Platform.

To better explain it, see what really happens when you call

```bash
dabs.sh -c examples/apps/hello-world-app --destination build
```

The list bellow
is a set of commands executed for you by `abs`:

```bash
# app and chart versions in the Chart.yaml file are set using git changes (if configured)
ct lint --validate-maintainers=false --charts=examples/apps/hello-world-app --chart-yaml-schema=/abs/workdir/app_build_suite/build_steps/../../resources/ct_schemas/gs_metadata_chart_schema.yaml
kube-linter lint . --config .kube-linter.yaml
helm package examples/apps/hello-world-app --destination build
# now metadata is generated from the data collected during the build (if configured)
```

### Full usage help

To get an overview of available options, please run:

```bash
dabs.sh -h
```

To learn what the configuration options mean and how to use them, please follow to
[execution steps and their config options](#execution-steps-details-and-configuration).

## Tuning app-build-suite execution and running parts of the build process

This tool works by executing a series of so called `Build Steps`. In general, one `BuildSteps` is about
a single step in the Chart build process, like running a single external tool. Most of the build steps
are configurable
(run `./dabs.sh -h` to check available options and go to
[steps details and configuration](#execution-steps-details-and-configuration) for detailed description).

The important property in `app-build-suite` is that you can execute a subset of all the build steps.
This idea should be useful for integrating `abs` with other workflows, like CI/CD systems or for
running parts of the build process on your local machine during development. You can either run only a
selected set of steps using `--steps` option or you can run all of them excluding some steps
using `--skip-steps`. Check `dabs.sh -h` output for step names available to `--steps` and `--skip-steps`
flags.

To skip or include multiple step names, separate them with space, like in this example:

```bash
dabs.sh -c examples/apps/hello-world-app --skip-steps validate static_check
```

### Configuring app-build-suite

Every configuration option in `abs` can be configured in 3 ways. Starting from the highest to the lowest
priority, these are:

- command line arguments,
- environment variables,
- config file (`abs` tries first to load the config file from the chart's directory `.abs/main.yaml` file; if
  it doesn't exist, then it tries to load the default config file from the current working directory's
  `.abs.main.yaml`).

When you run `dabs.sh -h` it shows you command line options and the relevant environment variables names. Options
for a config file are the same as for command line, just with truncated leading `--`. You can check
[this example](examples/apps/hello-world-app/.abs/main.yaml).

The configuration is made this way so you can put your defaults into the config file, yet override them with
env variables or command line when needed. This way you can easily override configs for stuff like CI/CD builds.

## Execution steps details and configuration

When `abs` runs, it executes all the steps from the *build* pipeline. Config options can be used to
disable/enable any specific build steps.
Please check below for available steps and their config options.

Currently, only one build pipeline is supported. It is based on `helm 3`. Please check
[this doc](../app-build-suite/docs/helm3-build-pipeline.md) for
detailed description of steps and available config options.
