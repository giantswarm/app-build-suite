# How to use app-build-suite to build and optionally test an app

## Preparing tools

To be able to complete this tutorial, you need a few tools:

- `app-build-suite` itself; if you haven't done so already, we recommend getting the latest version of the `dabs.sh` helper from [releases](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-build-suite/releases)
- for the building part
  - [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- for the testing part
  - a working python environment that you can use to install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)
    - if you already have python, it should be enough to run `pip install -U pipenv`
  - to be able to use the shortest path, you also need a working python 3.8 environment
    - to avoid problems like missing the specific python version, we highly recommend
      [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) for managing python environments; once `pyenv` is installed, it's enough to run `pyenv install 3.8.6` to get the python environment you need

## Building your app

The project we'll be working on is available in the `examples/tutorial` directory
of this repository. It's content is a ready helm chart that we want to build
with `abs`.
To get started, let's switch to that directory and create an `.abs` subdirectory:

```bash
cd examples/tutorial
mkdir .abs

```

Now, we need to prepare a config file for `abs`. In the `.abs` directory we've just
created, we need to create a `main.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
replace-chart-version-with-git: true
generate-metadata: true
catalog-base-url: http://localhost/
```

The first line of the config file will make `abs` set versions in our chart according to ones
detected from the local git repository. The other two are needed only if you want to generate
metadata required for advanced features of the Giant Swarm App Platform. If you want
to learn more, check the [more detailed description](pytest-test-pipeline.md).

We're almost ready to go. One technical detail: when running `abs` using
`dabs.sh`, your current working directory is mapped to inside the docker container.
We have configured `abs` to set our chart version using commit information
from `git`, but our current directory doesn't contain any `git` repository - only
the parent directory does. So, the simplest thing we can do is to move up in our
directory structure and invoke `dabs.sh` from a directory where also `git`'s `.git`
directory is. Since we haven't prepared any tests for our app yet, we're also
requesting `abs` to skip any tests:

```bash
$ cd ../../..
$ dabs.sh -c examples/tutorial --skip-steps test_all

What happened here? A few things:

- our chart was validated using `ct` and `kube-linter` tools
- version information in our chart was set to `0.2.2-9e1d8665b328e957d8637e44674434aed8a3bf4a`
- finally our chart was built with Helm

As a result, we have a new helm chart file and metadata files generated for the
App Platform:

```bash
$ ls -la hello-world-app-0.2.2-9e1d8665b328e957d8637e44674434aed8a3bf4a.*

```

## Testing your app

### How does it work?

`abs` can run your tests as part of the app build process. Still, `abs` doesn't
implement any tests nor cares about how you implement them. The contract is just
that `abs` can invoke a specific `pytest` commands for you. If you implement your
tests using `pytest`, `abs` can start them automatically. More information is
available [here](pytest-test-pipeline.md). Still the recommended way to implement
tests for running with `abs` is using `pytest` and our plugin called
[`pytest-helm-charts`](https://github.com/giantswarm/pytest-helm-charts).

### Why do I need a specific python version?

In general, you can use any python version you want, unless you're using the
dockerized `dabs.sh` wrapper, which is also our recommended way of running `abs`.
Inside the docker image `dabs.sh` is using, there's only one python version available.
This python version is used by `abs` to invoke your tests implemented with `pytest`.
As a result, if you request any other python version than the one currently used
by `dabs.sh`, you'll get an error, as that version is not available inside the docker
image.

You can check the current python version (and versions of all the other software
projects `abs` is using) by running:

```bash
$ dabs.sh versions
-> python env:
Python 3.8.6
pip 20.3.1 from /abs/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
pipenv, version 2020.11.15
...
```

### Writing the tests

We'll now write some basic tests for the HelloWorld app we've built above in
[building your app](#building-your-app).

#### Preparing environment

Let's create a directory for storing tests. `abs` looks for them in the `tests/abs`
subdirectory of the helm chart, so let's start a fresh python virtual env there:

```bash
$ mkdir -p examples/tutorial/tests/abs
$ cd examples/tutorial/tests/abs
$ pipenv --python 3.8
Creating a virtualenv for this project...
Pipfile: /home/piontec/work/giantswarm/git/app-build-suite/examples/tutorial/tests/abs/Pipfile

✔ Successfully created virtual environment!
Virtualenv location: /home/piontec/.virtualenvs/abs-4WvsKJg-
Creating a Pipfile for this project...
```

Now, we need to add our dependencies. If we're going to use `pytest-helm-chart`,
everything else will come as dependencies:

```bash
$ pipenv install "pytest-helm-charts>=0.3.1"
Installing pytest-helm-charts>=0.3.1...
Adding pytest-helm-charts to Pipfile's [packages]...
✔ Installation Succeeded

  🐍   ▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉ 0/0 — 00:00:00
```

As a result, our `Pipfile` should look like this basic version:

```toml
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
pytest-helm-charts = ">=0.3.1"

[dev-packages]

[requires]
python_version = "3.8"
```

#### Implementing tests

Now we can start implementing actual tests. To get a full sample source code,
just copy the `test_example.py` [file](../examples/apps/hello-world-app/tests/abs/test_example.py) to our `tests/abs` directory, so it looks like this:

```bash
$ ls
Pipfile  Pipfile.lock  test_example.py
```

The simplest test case code in the `test_example.py` file looks like this:

```python
from typing import cast

import pytest
import pykube
from pytest_helm_charts.fixtures import Cluster


@pytest.mark.smoke
def test_we_have_environment(kube_cluster: Cluster) -> None:
    assert kube_cluster.kube_client is not None
    assert len(pykube.Node.objects(kube_cluster.kube_client)) >= 1
```

In this test, we're only checking if we can get a working connection object to
work with our cluster. This is done by requesting the `kube_cluster: Cluster` object
for our test (test method parameters are [pytest fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html) and are injected for you by the test framework itself).
Additionally, we're marking our test as a "smoke" test. This information is provided
for `abs` itself: we want to include opinionated test scenarios in `abs` and that
way `abs` knows if it should run your test for specific scenario or not.

You can read more about [how `abs` executes tests](./pytest-test-pipeline.md) and
how to implement them with [pytest-helm-charts](https://pytest-helm-charts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html), including information about
[available fixtures](https://pytest-helm-charts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pytest_helm_charts.fixtures/).

#### Running tests

We are now ready to build our test chart again, but this time running tests we've
implemented. To do that, we need to have a cluster where we can deploy our chart
and then execute our tests against a running application. Do make this time
efficient, we'll use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
We're going to use embedded `abs` ability to create `kind` clusters, but remember
that you can use any existing cluster you like - you just need to pass a `kube.config`
file to `abs`. `abs` can run different types of tests on different clusters, so we have
to pass cluster type option twice, but our cluster will be reused for both kinds
of tests:

```bash

That's it. In a single step we have validated, linted, built and tested a new helm

and already has the optional metadata files generated. Now upload the chart to your
chart registry and start rolling it out to clusters!
