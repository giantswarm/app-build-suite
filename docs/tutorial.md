# How to use app-build-suite to build an app

## Preparing tools

To be able to complete this tutorial, you need a few tools:

- `app-build-suite` itself; if you haven't done so already, we recommend getting the latest version of the `dabs.sh`
  helper from [releases](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-build-suite/releases)
- for the building part
  - [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- for the testing part
  - a working python environment that you can use to install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)
    - if you already have python, it should be enough to run `pip install -U pipenv`
  - to be able to use the shortest path, you also need a working python 3.8 environment
    - to avoid problems like missing the specific python version, we highly recommend
      [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) for managing python environments; once `pyenv` is
      installed, it's enough to run `pyenv install 3.8.6` to get the python environment you need

## Building your app

The project we'll be working on is available in the `examples/tutorial` directory
of this repository. It's content is a ready helm chart that we want to build
with `abs`.
To get started, let's switch to that directory and create an `.abs` subdirectory:

```bash
cd examples/tutorial
mkdir .abs

```

Now, we need to prepare a config file for `abs`. In the `.abs` directory we've just
created, we need to create a `main.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
replace-chart-version-with-git: true
generate-metadata: true
catalog-base-url: http://localhost/
```

The first line of the config file will make `abs` set versions in our chart according to ones
detected from the local git repository. The other two are needed only if you want to generate
metadata required for advanced features of the Giant Swarm App Platform. If you want
to learn more, check the [more detailed description](pytest-test-pipeline.md).

We're almost ready to go. One technical detail: when running `abs` using
`dabs.sh`, your current working directory is mapped to inside the docker container.
We have configured `abs` to set our chart version using commit information
from `git`, but our current directory doesn't contain any `git` repository - only
the parent directory does. So, the simplest thing we can do is to move up in our
directory structure and invoke `dabs.sh` from a directory where also `git`'s `.git`
directory is. Since we haven't prepared any tests for our app yet, we're also
requesting `abs` to skip any tests:

```bash
$ cd ../../..
$ dabs.sh -c examples/tutorial

What happened here? A few things:

- our chart was validated using `ct` and `kube-linter` tools
- version information in our chart was set to `0.2.2-9e1d8665b328e957d8637e44674434aed8a3bf4a`
- finally our chart was built with Helm

As a result, we have a new helm chart file and metadata files generated for the
App Platform:

```bash
$ ls -la hello-world-app-0.2.2-9e1d8665b328e957d8637e44674434aed8a3bf4a.*
-rw-r--r-- 1 piontec piontec 1993 kwi 28 16:48 hello-world-app-0.2.2-9e1d8665b328e957d8637e44674434aed8a3bf4a.tgz

hello-world-app-0.2.2-9e1d8665b328e957d8637e44674434aed8a3bf4a.tgz-meta:
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 1 piontec piontec    72 kwi 28 16:48 .
drwxrwxr-x 1 piontec piontec  1168 kwi 28 16:51 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 piontec piontec  1011 kwi 28 16:48 main.yaml
-rw-rw-r-- 1 piontec piontec 11664 mar  2 14:41 README.md
-rw-rw-r-- 1 piontec piontec   300 paź 21  2020 values.schema.json
```

That's it. In a single step we have validated, linted and built a new helm
chart. Additionally, the chart is ready to be used with Giant Swarm App Platform
and already has the optional metadata files generated. Now upload the chart to your
chart registry and start rolling it out to clusters! Please also check
[app-test-suite](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-test-suite) for a tool
that takes your Chart built with `abs` and runs tests for it.
