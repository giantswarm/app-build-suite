## [Unreleased]

### Added

- in metadata files, `dateCreated` is now formated the same way as in `index.yaml` created by helm

## [0.1.7] - 2021-02-03

### Changed

- Remove capturing of external processes stdout and stderr - they are now printed live by the process itself.

## [0.1.6] - 2021-02-03

### Fixed

- Do not fail if `replace-chart-version-with-git` nor `replace-app-version-with-git` config options are specified.

- Do not try to remove the App CR if app deployment was skipped.

## [0.1.5] - 2021-01-15

### Changes

- Breaking: `step_unit` name was misleading, renamed now to `step_validate`
