# Changelog

Based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Added
  - Add `push-to-app-catalog` GitHub Action

- Changed
  - Enabling `kube-linter` verbose output by default

## [1.0.4] - 2021-09-21

- Changed
  - Upgrade Helm to 3.7.0

## [1.0.3] - 2021-09-16

- Changed
  - Upgrade python version in container image to 3.8.12
  - Upgrade conftest version in container to 0.27.0

## [1.0.2] - 2021-08-10

- Changed
  - Giant Swarm metadata generator supports now the `upstreamChartVersion` field in `Chart.yaml`. This field has
    to be specified if `upstreamChartUrl` is present.

## [1.0.1] - 2021-06-29

- Changed
  - Breaking change: the build and test functionality is now split into 2 projects. The build part is
    left here in this project, the test part is now a separate project called
    [`app-test-suite`](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-test-suite).

## [0.2.3] - 2021-05-24

- Changed
  - Update our derived chart schema for chart-testing ahead of a chart-testing release to fix issues
    with local subcharts requiring a `repository` field.
  - All dependencies updated, including:
    - python dependencies
    - pre-commit dependencies
    - binaries in docker image:
      - `helm` 3.5.4
      - `kubectl` 1.20.7
      - `ct` 3.4.0
      - `apptestctl` 0.8.0
      - `kube-linter` 0.2.2

## [0.2.2] - 2021-03-23

- Added
  - Support for `requirements.lock` file updating

## [0.2.1] - 2021-03-02

- Added
  - `icon` and `home` attributes are now copied over from `Chart.yaml` to metadata's `main.yaml`
  - support for the [kube-linter](https://docs.kubelinter.io/) static chart verification tool

- Changed
  - **breaking change**: the option `--ct-chart-repos` is now removed, because in `ct` command line options are
    overriding user supplied values in the `ct`'s config file. So far, `abs` was passing stable helm charts stable
    repo by default using command line argument. To fix compatibility with user-supplied `ct` config, `abs`
    stops passing `chart-repos` in command line, so if you need the stable helm charts repo to pass validation with
    `ct`, you're now responsible for creating the correct config file.
  - in metadata files, `dateCreated` is now formatted the same way as in `index.yaml` created by helm
  - update binary dependencies:
    - helm: 3.5.2
    - chart-test: 3.3.1
    - apptestctl: 0.7.0
    - docker: 20.10.3

- Fixed
  - `compatibleProviders` is now added to `ct`'s schema file and is correctly validated
  - remove not-yet-used test types from STEPS_ALL, which resulted in printing pointless steps as available
  - change the simple HelmBuilderValidator build step to STEP_BUILD, so it's executed even when some steps other than
    STEP_BUILD are excluded from run
  - remove redundant test-enabling options (`--enable-XYZ-tests`); use `--skip-steps` to exclude them
  - change validation step name from 'test_validate' to 'validate' (it is not part of a test scenario)
  - **breaking change** '--app-tests-deploy' was a flag, not a value option, but was described as a value option;
    changed to '--app-tests-skip-deploy'
  - cluster reuse when no cluster config file is used was failing and requesting a new cluster anyway
  - printing version - had "vvXYZ" double "v" prefix

## [0.1.7] - 2021-02-03

- Changed
  - Remove capturing of external processes stdout and stderr - they are now printed live by the process itself.

## [0.1.6] - 2021-02-03

- Fixed
  - Do not fail if `replace-chart-version-with-git` nor `replace-app-version-with-git` config options are specified.
  - Do not try to create the App CR if it already exists.
  - Do not try to remove the App CR if app deployment was skipped.
  - Handle Chart.lock file if it exists and `replace-chart-version-with-git` is specified.

- Added
  - Each command executed is now printed to stdout. If '--debug' is enabled, also full stdout and stderr of each command
    executed is printed

## [0.1.5] - 2021-01-15

- Changes
  - Breaking: `step_unit` name was misleading, renamed now to `step_validate`
  - fix: loading the config file from the root of current working dir. Note: you can safely add `chart-dir` option to
    the config file, if the file is placed in work dir root

## [0.1.4] - 2021-01-14

- fixed release process to correctly attach `dabs.sh` as build artefact

## [0.1.3] - 2021-01-14

- `kind` is now supported as an internal cluster creation mechanism

## [0.1.2] - 2021-01-07

- Added
  - Update `apptestctl` dependency to 0.6.0

## [0.1.1] - 2020-12-22

Initial release

- added: metadata includes now `annotations` and `chartApiVersion` fields
- changed:
  - versions skip the leading 'v' now if it was present in git tag (backward compatible naming)
  - config file is loaded from `.abs/main.yaml`, not from `.abs.yaml` (for future needs)
- testing basic classes and pipelines
